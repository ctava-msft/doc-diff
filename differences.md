## Difference between Document Version 1 and Document Version 2

The differences between Document Version 1 and Document Version 2 are as follows:

1. **Section 1.3.1**:
   - **Version 1**: The contractor shall designate or identify those providers who furnish proof (i.e., certificates) that they have completed:
     - The “Military Culture: Core Competencies for Healthcare Professionals” course developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs/Veterans Health Administration (DVA/VHA) under the auspices of Integrated Mental Health Strategy (IMHS); and
     - The following courses: “Cognitive Processing Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Veterans and Military Personnel,” “Prolonged Exposure (PE) Therapy for PTSD in Veterans and Military Personnel,” and “Depression in Service Members and Veterans in evidence-based treatments,” offered by the Center for Deployment Psychology (CDP) of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.
   - **Version 2**: The contractor shall designate or identify those providers who furnish proof (i.e., certificates) that they have completed:
     - The package of courses approved by the Government. The approved course list is located at https://deploymentpsych.org/TPRD. In lieu of proof from certificates, the contractor shall establish the provider readiness designation from the list of providers completing the course package that is provided by the Government.

2. **Section 1.3.1.1**:
   - **Version 1**: This section does not exist.
   - **Version 2**: The contractor shall ensure providers who have earned the provider readiness designation based on initial training course requirements will maintain the provider readiness designation with no need for additional training.

3. **Section 1.3.1.2**:
   - **Version 1**: This section does not exist.
   - **Version 2**: The contractor shall ensure providers will maintain the provider readiness designation as the DoD approved package of training courses is updated with no need for additional training.

These are the primary differences between the two versions of the document. The changes mainly focus on the criteria and maintenance of the "provider readiness designation" for non-Department mental health providers.

## Difference between Document Version 1 and Document Version 3

Here are the differences between Document Version 1 and Document Version 3:

1. **Section 1.3.1**:
   - **Version 1**: Specifies the courses required for the provider readiness designation, including "Military Culture: Core Competencies for Healthcare Professionals" and courses offered by the Center for Deployment Psychology.
   - **Version 3**: Simplifies the requirement by stating that providers must complete the package of courses approved by the Government, with the approved course list available at a specified URL. It also allows the contractor to establish the provider readiness designation from a list provided by the Government.

2. **Section 1.3.1.1 and 1.3.1.2**:
   - **Version 1**: These sections do not exist.
   - **Version 3**: Adds new sections stating that providers who have earned the provider readiness designation based on initial training course requirements will maintain the designation without needing additional training, even as the DoD-approved package of training courses is updated.

3. **Section 2.4**:
   - **Version 1**: Requires the contractor to consider the health characteristics of the beneficiaries in a given market, including an analysis of disease prevalence and overall health and well-being, and to use predictive analytics in the development of its network implementation plan.
   - **Version 3**: Removes this requirement, stating that the contractor does not need to consider the health characteristics of the beneficiaries or conduct an analysis of disease prevalence and overall health and well-being.

These are the primary differences between the two versions of the document. The changes mainly focus on simplifying the requirements for the provider readiness designation and removing the need for health characteristic analysis in network development.

## Difference between Document Version 1 and Document Version 4

The differences between Document Version 1 and Document Version 4 are substantial. Here is a detailed comparison:

1. **Document Structure and Content:**
   - **Version 1:** Contains a comprehensive and detailed set of guidelines and requirements for network development, including sections on general requirements, geographic availability, enrollment, network requirements and standards, provider directory, access standards, urgent care centers, claims participation, balance billing, billing for non-covered services, health information exchanges, network provider education, and durable medical equipment providers.
   - **Version 4:** Contains only a single sentence: "The contractor gets the day off."

2. **Specific Sections and Details:**
   - **Version 1:** 
     - **General Requirements:** Detailed instructions on establishing a provider network, mental health provider readiness designation, and promotion of provider readiness designation.
     - **Geographic Availability:** Requirements for establishing and maintaining a provider network to meet access standards for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select beneficiaries.

     - **Durable Medical Equipment Providers:** Establishing preferred provider contracts for DME supplies.

   - **Version 4:** 
     - **General Requirements:** Only includes the statement "The contractor gets the day off."

3. **Overall Content Volume:**
   - **Version 1:** Extensive and detailed, spanning multiple sections and covering a wide range of topics related to network development and management.
   - **Version 4:** Extremely brief, consisting of only one sentence.

4. **Purpose and Instructions:**
   - **Version 1:** Provides detailed instructions and requirements for the contractor to follow in developing and maintaining a provider network for TRICARE beneficiaries.
   - **Version 4:** Does not provide any instructions or requirements related to network development; instead, it simply states that the contractor gets the day off.
